# Replay every checked-in corpus input through its fuzz target.
#
# This is the regression half of the fuzzing work: OSS-Fuzz (or a local run)
# finds a crashing input, it gets committed under corpus/, and from then on
# every `make check` re-runs it. No clang and no libFuzzer needed - the
# targets are built with the standalone driver in this mode - so the check
# works on every platform the suite builds on, which is the point.
#
# Build it under --enable-asan for this to catch anything subtler than an
# outright segfault.

# Match the fuzzing setup and the asan CI job: leak detection off.
#
# Under --enable-asan this script is exactly where the corpus is most useful,
# and without this it fails there for the wrong reason - the tools exit without
# freeing everything, so LeakSanitizer reports and the runner calls a clean
# replay a crash. Memory *corruption* is what the corpus is guarding, and that
# is still fully checked.
